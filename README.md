## A Simple Website
While there is nothing extremely fancy with this website, we are
utilizing PHP for the base framework, and we are using Bootstrap
5.2 for the GUI elements CSS. In order to handle some of the JavaScript
functions, we are creating our own JavaScript library.

## Checkout
We will be integrating Square payments in order to handle
the purchase of the products. Waiting on client to setup
Square and send us the Developers Login in order to get
them setup.
